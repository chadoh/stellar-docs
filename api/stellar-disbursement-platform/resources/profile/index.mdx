Profiles endpoints manage the process of getting and updating profile information, including password reset. 

Organizations and individual SDP users both have profiles. The organization's profile has basic information set at the time of SDP deployment. It can be modified by the Owner. Individual profile information is set when the account is created and can be updated by the user on the SDP dashboard Profile page. Note: profiles never refer to receivers of funds.
