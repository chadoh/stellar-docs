A payment operation sends an amount in a specific asset (XLM or non-XLM) to a destination account. With a basic payment operation, the asset sent is the same as the asset received. BasicPay also allows for path payments (where the asset sent is different than the asset received), which we’ll talk about in the next section.

In our BasicPay application, we’ll add a “Send Payment” button that allows the user to input the public key of a destination address with a specified asset they’d like to send along with the amount of the asset. The application will first verify that the destination account exists and is properly funded with XLM.

An asset is displayed as an asset code and issuer address. Learn more in our [Assets section](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/fundamentals-and-concepts/stellar-data-structures/assets).

All Stellar transactions require a small fee to make it to the ledger. Read more in our [Fees, Surge Pricing, and Fee Strategies section](../../encyclopedia/fees-surge-pricing-fee-strategies).

In BasicPay, we’ve set it up so that the user always pays a static fee of 100,000 [stroops](../../fundamentals-and-concepts/stellar-data-structures/assets#amount-precision) (one stroop equals 0.0000001 XLM) per operation. Alternatively, you can add a feature to your application that allows the user to set their own fee.

Finally, the user will click the “Send” button, which triggers a modal with the transaction preview where the user will input their pincode and click “Confirm” which signs and submits the transaction to the ledger.
