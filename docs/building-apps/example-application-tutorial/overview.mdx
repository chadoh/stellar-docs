In this tutorial, we’ll walk through the steps needed to build a basic payment application on Stellar’s Testnet. After this tutorial, you should have a good understanding of the fundamental Stellar concepts and a solid base for iterative development.

For this tutorial, we’ll walk through the steps as we build a sample application we’ve called [BasicPay](https://basicpay.pages.dev), which will be used to showcase various features.

:::caution

**Although BasicPay is a full-fledged application on Stellar’s Testnet, it has been built solely to showcase Stellar functionality for the educational purposes of this tutorial, not to be copied, pasted, and used on Mainnet.**

## Project setup

### Project requirements

To build a basic Stellar application, you’ll need:

- Application framework (for BasicPay, we use SvelteKit opting for JavaScript with JSDoc typing, and we used [svelte-add](https://github.com/svelte-add/svelte-add) to get our project started)
- Frontend framework (for BasicPay, we’re using Daisy UI to simplify the use of Tailwind CSS)
- A way to interact with the Stellar network (for BasicPay, we use the [js-stellar-sdk](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-sdk), but you could use traditional fetch requests)
- A way to interact with the user’s keypair (for BasicPay, we are using the [js-stellar-wallets SDK](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-wallets), but you can opt to use an existing wallet)

While we are using the above components to construct our application, we have done our best to build it in such a way that dependency on any one of these things is minimized. Ideally, you should be able to use the JavaScript code we’ve written and plug it into any other framework you’d like with minimal effort.

We’ve made the following choices during the development of this application that you may need to consider as you follow this project:

- We’ve designed this app with a desktop in mind.
- We’re using a dark mode theme. No light mode is available, so deal with it.
- This is written as a client-side application. No server-side actions actually take place.
- We’re deploying this as a static site with Cloudflare pages.

### Dev helpers

- [Friendbot](https://friendbot.stellar.org/): a bot that funds accounts with 10,000 fake XLM on Stellar’s Testnet
- [Testnet toml file](https://testanchor.stellar.org/.well-known/stellar.toml)
