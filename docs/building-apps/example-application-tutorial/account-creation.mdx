Accounts are the central data structure in Stellar and can only exist with a valid keypair (a public and secret key) and the required minimum balance of XLM. Read more in the [Accounts section](../../fundamentals-and-concepts/stellar-data-structures/accounts).

To start, we'll have our user create an account. In BasicPay, the signup page will display a randomized public and secret keypair that the user can select with the option to choose a new set if preferred.

Since we are building a [non-custodial application], the encrypted secret key will only ever live in the browser. It will never be shared with a server or anybody else.

Next, we'll trigger the user to submit a pincode to encrypt their secret key before it gets saved to their browser's `localStorage` (this is handled by the [`js-stellar-wallets` SDK]). The user will need to remember their pincode for future logins and to submit transactions.

With BasicPay, when the user clicks the “Signup” button, they will be asked to confirm their pincode. When they do, the `create_account` operation is triggered, and the user's account is automatically funded with XLM for the minimum balance (starting with 10,000 XLM).

When you're ready to move the application to Pubnet, accounts will need to be funded with real XLM. This is something the application can cover itself by depositing XLM into the user's account (this is how we did it with BasicPay on Testnet, using Friendbot), with the use of [sponsored reserves], or the user can cover the required balance with their own XLM.
