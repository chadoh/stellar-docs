A path payment is where the asset sent can be different from the asset received. There are two possible path payment operations: 1) `path_payment_strict_send`, which allows the user to specify the amount of the asset to send, and 2) `path_payment_strict_receive`, which allows the user to specify the amount of the asset received.

With BasicPay, the user will input the public key of the destination address, specify the asset sent and the asset received, and the amount of asset either sent or received.

The user will then sign and submit the transaction to the network.

BasicPay also contains a swap feature, which allows the user to send themselves an asset in exchange for another asset. For example, receive USDC in exchange for your own XLM.
