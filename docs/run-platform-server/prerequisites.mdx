The Horizon service is responsible for synchronizing with the Stellar network and processing ledger data. We recommend reading the [Configuring section](./configuring.mdx) as a primer on scope of Horizon's services before diving into compute pre-requisites:

- Data ingestion: It ingests data from the decentralized Stellar network.
- Transaction submission: It submits transactions to the Stellar network.
- API serving: It serves API requests.

The Horizon service can be [installed](./installing.mdx) on bare metal or a virtual machine. It is natively supported on both Linux and Windows operating systems.

At a minimum, following the [Single Instance Deployment model](./configuring.mdx#single-instance-deployment) will require two compute instances:
* one compute instance for Horizon
* one compute instance for PostgreSQL server.

To run Horizon, we recommend a single compute profile which is applicable for single or multiple instances, the minimum hardware specifications are:

**Horizon compute instance:**

- CPU: x cores
- RAM: x GB
- Storage: SSD with a capacity of x GB

**PostgreSQL database server compute instance:**

- CPU: x cores
- RAM: x GB
- Storage: SSD with a capacity of x TB (NVMe or Direct Attached Storage) capable of handling >xk IOPS (I/O operations per second).

These specifications consider a 30-day retention window for data storage. For a longer retention window, the system requirements will change accordingly. Consult the [ingestion](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/run-api-server/ingestion) for details on data ingestion and history retention, and managing storage requirements.

**Network**

- The compute instance must be able to connect to the PostgreSQL database. The default port for PostgreSQL is 5432.
- A stable and fast Internet connection is recommended to ensure efficient communication with the Stellar network.

**Production Setup**

For a full-scale production setup, multiple instances of Horizon can be run, with each instance performing one or more functions. For details on achieving high availability, redundancy, and high throughput, refer to the [scaling](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/run-api-server/scaling).

**Additional Notes**

_Hardware requirements may increase if sharing resources or using custom configs, and as the Stellar network grows._
